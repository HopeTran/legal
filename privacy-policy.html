<h2>Website Information Collection and Use</h2>


<p>
It is not necessary to provide Company with your personally identifiable information to use the Web Site, and Company does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the Web Site.

When you visit the Web Site or use the Website to download an Application, Company's servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address may be different every time you log on. Company uses Log Data to monitor use of the Web Site and the services we offer via the Web Site and for the Web Site's technical administration.  
</p>
<h2>Application Information Collection and Use</h2>


<p>
We collect the following information in connection with your use of the Applications, and use it as described:
</p><ul>

<li>Your email address is required to use the web version of the Application. We use your email address to provide the web version of the Application to you and to communicate with you about your use of the Application.

It is not attached to other personally identifiable information unless (a) you are using the web version of the Application, in which case your Bitmark Account Number is tied to your email address, or (b) you specifically choose to publicly identify your account with an email address or other personal information.
<li>The source, title and metadata regarding each Digital Asset managed through our Services, a thumbnail picture of that Digital Asset (only if the Digital Asset is not encrypted), and the associated bitmark. This information is public.

</p>
<h2>Public Information</h2>


<p>
Any information in the Bitmark Property System is <em>permanently and irrevocably public by design</em>.  That includes the public key that forms your Bitmark Account Number, the bitmarks themselves, and the records of any transfers of bitmarks to or from your Bitmark Account.   
</p>
<p>
You are not required to disclose any information in your public profile within the Services, and you can encrypt Digital Assets to prevent our Services from creating thumbnails of those Digital Assets.  However, any information you provide to us when you publicly identify your account, in the title or metadata of your Digital Asset, or in unencrypted Digital Assets is publicly viewable, and is not in any way confidential or private.  Think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.
